**Simple CryptoCurrrency Prices**  

This simple,short script helps you run rest-ful api for listing crypto currencies prices via CoinMarketCap api.

in order to get it to work, you need to get a API key from coinmarketcap from https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/account and replace the API key in **settings.js** with your own key.

Also, you can change IP, Port and delay for API requests in **settings.js** as well.

this script is still under developement and other feautures are comming in near future, so keep comming around ;)
